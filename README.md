# Mars online

Hello? This is ground control. Do you read me?

Humanity can’t stop dreaming about exploring endless space and colonizing new planets, but while we’re waiting for manned flights to Mars let’s build a cool app. Our app’s goal is to romanticize Mars by letting people know how beautiful it is. Thankfully, NASA has 3 rovers that provide us with imaginary from Mars.

Work in progress! Stay tuned!
